The content of this exercise has significantly increased compared to previous ones. 
The difficulty of the first two tasks is acceptable, but the third requires the use of other tools. 
For me, I used Grok and deepseek to help me achieve the goal of having the third task output a full animation to simulate the process of disease transmission in a population over time. 
Since I did not know how to generate animations, I sought help from AI and learned to understand the code they provided. 
There is another issue in this practice: the guide mentions copying the code from task 1 into task 2 and then completing task 2 based on task 1. 
However, in my actual practice, I found that there is a significant difference in the logic between task 2 and task 1, and only a small part of the code in task 1 can be directly used in task 2.
